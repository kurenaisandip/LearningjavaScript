// Accidentally using the Assignment operator
assignment operator =

// An assignment always returns the value of the assignment.

// Expecting loose comparison
//  comparing string with number

switch //uses strict comparison

// Misunderstanding Floats
// All numbers in JavaScript are stored as 64-bits Floating point numbers (Floats).

// All programming languages, including JavaScript, have difficulties with precise floating point values:

let x = 0.1;
let y = 0.2;
let z = x + y            // the result in z will not be 0.3


// Breaking a JavaScript String
// JavaScript will allow you to break a statement into two lines:

Example 1
let x =
"Hello World!";
// But, breaking a statement in the middle of a string will not work:

Example 2
let x = "Hello
World!";

// You must use a "backslash" if you must break a statement in a string:
