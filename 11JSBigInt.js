// JS BigInt variables are used to store big integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal javascript Number.

// JS Integer Accuracy
// js integer are only accurate upto 15 digits.

// integer precision:
let x = 999999999999999;
let y = 9999999999999999;


// How to create a BigInt

// to create a BigInt, append n to the end of an integer or call BigInt()

let z= 2139234238238123234324234234234n;

let v = BigInt(23746287346872364872364823648236478234);
