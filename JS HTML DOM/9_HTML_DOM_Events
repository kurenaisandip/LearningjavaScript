// Html DOM allows js to react to Html events

// Reacting to Events 

// A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.

// To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:

onclick = javaScript

Examples
// When a user clicks the mouse
// when a web page has loaded
// when an image has been loaded
// when the mouse moves over an elements
// when an input field is changed 
// when an HTML form is submitted
// when a user strokes a key


// In this example, the content of the <h1> element is changed when a user clicks on it:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 onclick="this.innerHTML = 'Ooops!'">Click on this text!</h1>

</body>
</html>


// In this example, a function is called from the event handler:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 onclick="changeText(this)">Click on this text!</h1>

<script>
function changeText(id) {
  id.innerHTML = "Ooops!";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>





// HTML Event Attributes
// To assign events to HTML elements you can use event attributes.

<button onclick="displayDate()">Try it</button>





// The onload and onunload Events
// The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.

// The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on the information.

// The onload and onunload events can be used to deal with cookies.


<body onload="checkCookies()"></body>





// The onchange Event
// The onchange event is often used in combination with validation of input fields.

// Below is an example of how to use the onchange. The upperCase() function will be called when a user changes the content of an input field.

<input type="text" id="fname" onchange="upperCase()"></input>






// The onmouseover and onmouseout Events
// The onmouseover and onmouseout events can be used to trigger a function when the user mouses over, or out of, an HTML element:



// The onmousedown, onmouseup and onclick Events
