JS HTML Dom Collections

The HTMLCollection Object

<!-- The getElementsByTagName() method returns an HTMLCollection object.

An HTMLCollection object is an array-like list (collection) of HTML elements.

The following code selects all <p> elements in a document: -->

    const myCollection = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

    <!-- The elements in the collection can be accessed by an index number.

To access the second <p> element you can write: -->

myCollection[1]


<!-- the length property defines the number of elements in an HTMLCollection: -->

myCollection.length 



<!-- The length property is useful when you want to loop through the elements in a collection:
 -->

 <!-- Change the text color of all <p> elements: -->

    const myCollection = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
    for (let i = 0; i < myCollection.length; i++) {
      myCollection[i].style.color = "red";
    }



    <!-- An HTMLCollection is NOT an array! -->

An HTMLCollection may look like an array, but it is not.

You can loop through the list and refer to the elements with a number (just like an array).

However, you cannot use array methods like valueOf(), pop(), push(), or join() on an HTMLCollection.
